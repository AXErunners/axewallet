Axewallet is the first iPhone wallet for Axe - Digital Cash - a better innovative alternative to bitcoin.
 
Axe is a crypto currency that seeks out fix the flaws that other crypto currencies suffer from.  It relies on a network of Masternodes to allow such things as anonymity, instant transaction, and direct funding mechanism to kickstart innovative ideas.

Even if your phone is lost, damaged or stolen, you can easily recover your funds using your personal recovery phrase. 

Features:

* Send and receive axe payments in seconds, online or in person
* One button payments to axe-accepting merchants and websites
* Pay quickly with Face ID recognition

Axewallet is open source and free. There are no extra transaction fees or costs. Send any amount of money to anyone in the world instantly. This is how money should be.

An earlier version of Axewallet was a close descendant of breadwallet, a Bitcoin wallet for iPhone. This version has since heavily diverged. We would still like to commend Aaron Voisine, co-author of BIP 32 and creator of breadwallet, for his pioneering work in the field.
